I am a PhD candidate at [Institute of Medical Science](https://ims.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in the [Kimel Lab](https://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/). My doctoral work combines advanced computational techniques with multimodal data to improve understanding, early detection, and intervention in schizophrenia and youth at risk. I am also passionate about evidence-based teaching and curriculum development, creating active, inclusive learning experiences that build critical thinking and data literacy.
