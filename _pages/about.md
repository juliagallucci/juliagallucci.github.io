I am a PhD candidate at [Institute of Medical Science](https://ims.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in the [Kimel Lab](https://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/). 

My doctoral research uses advanced multivariate techniques to disentangle overlapping symptom dimensions in psychosis. I investigate the neural circuitry underlying depressive and negative symptoms in adults with schizophrenia and characterize multimodal risk profiles in youth experiencing distressing psychotic-like experiences. By examining these questions across populations, my work aims to clarify how conflated symptom domains complicate research in psychosis and to inform early detection and intervention strategies.

Outside of the lab, I am deeply committed to teaching and curriculum development. My teaching philosophy is shaped by my interdisciplinary background and experiences as a student, teaching assistant, course instructor, and curriculum developer in biostatistics, data science, and psychology/neuroscience at the University of Toronto. These experiences deepened my passion for evidence-based teaching and pedagogical research and allowed me to approach teaching from multiple perspectives, reflecting on how best to support learning, engagement, and intellectual growth.

I view teaching as a dynamic, reciprocal process, evolving with every class, every student question, and every new challenge. At the core of my approach is the belief that students learn best when they are actively engaged, feel supported, and see the relevance of what they are learning to their broader goals. I design activities that encourage active participation, such as live coding exercises, case-based problem solving, and collaborative analysis of primary research articles, while fostering dialogue and collaboration between students and instructor. Clear, inclusive communication and evidence-based strategies like retrieval practice, elaboration, and interleaving are central to my approach, helping students build confidence, critical thinking, and independent learning skills.

Together, my research and teaching reflect a commitment to rigorous, data-driven investigation of mental health and a dedication to cultivating the next generation of scientists and data-literate learners. I aim to translate insights from computational neuroscience into practical understanding while fostering an inclusive and engaging learning environment that prepares students to thrive in research, industry, or further study.
